# Dumpster Finder

An app for dumpster divers

## Requirements

This app is developed in React native, you'll need some (recent) version of `npm` installed.

## Usage

To run the app with connection to an instance of our backend,
you need to specify the address to the server.
**Make sure the server is running.**

Create a `.env` file with variables like those set in `.env.template` â€“ it might look like this:

```sh
API_URL=http://xxx.yy.zz:8080/
```

Then start the app in development mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you should be able to connect an emulator or a device to the Expo server.
